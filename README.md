AICTE OIB-SIP Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python
Task Description:
The Unemployment Analysis project involves an in-depth exploration of historical labor market data and the prediction of future unemployment rates using advanced data science techniques. The primary objective is to uncover insights and formulate actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

Approach:
This project employs Python, along with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, to conduct a thorough analysis and visualization of unemployment data. The process includes reading, preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing the data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the unemployment landscape.

Setup and Requirements:
To execute this project, Python must be installed on your system, along with the following libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, IPython, and access to Google Colab.

Data Source:
The dataset for this project is contained within the file "Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020[1].csv". It encompasses a range of historical labor market metrics, such as state-wise unemployment rates, employment figures, labor participation rates, and geographical coordinates.
